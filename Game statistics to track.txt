To better understand the strategies players use in your game and how effective they are, consider tracking the following game statistics:

X Total score: Track each player's total score throughout the game to evaluate their overall performance.
X Number of exploratory moves: Count how many times a player reveals a new card that they haven't seen before in prior games. This will help you quantify their exploration behavior.
X Number of exploitative moves: Count how many times a player selects a card they've seen before in a prior game and know the value of. This will help you quantify their exploitation behavior.
Exploration/exploitation ratio: Calculate the ratio of exploratory moves to exploitative moves for each player. This can help you determine their preference for exploration or exploitation.
Proportion of board unexplored at end of game: Calculate the proportion of cards the player has not yet at any point during 
Turn-by-turn decision time: Record the time taken by each player to make a decision on each turn. This can help you analyze their decision-making process and understand whether they spend more time on exploration or exploitation.
