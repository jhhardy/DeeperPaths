The best way to keep track of these statistics within your code is to create a data structure that can store the relevant information for each player and each game session. You can then save this data to an external file or a database for later analysis. Here's a general outline of how you might do this:

Create a class or data structure to represent each player's game session, including their unique identifier (e.g., player ID), game ID, and other relevant information (e.g., timestamp).

Within this class or data structure, create variables or containers (e.g., lists, dictionaries) to store the different statistics you want to track, such as the total score, number of exploratory moves, number of exploitative moves, etc.

Update these variables or containers as players progress through the game. For example, when a player makes an exploratory move, increment the corresponding counter. Similarly, update the total score when they make a successful match.

At the end of each game session, store the player's game session data in an external file or database. You can use various formats for this, such as CSV, JSON, or a dedicated database like SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL, depending on your preferred method of data storage and analysis.

For later analysis, retrieve the stored data from the external file or database and load it into a suitable data analysis tool or environment, such as Python with Pandas, R, or Excel. This will allow you to perform statistical analyses, create visualizations, and draw conclusions about player behavior.

If you want to track game data in real-time, consider implementing a logging system that records events as they occur during the game. This can help you monitor player behavior and detect any issues that may arise during gameplay.

By organizing your code to track and store these statistics, you'll have a rich dataset to analyze and better understand user behavior in your game. This will enable you to answer questions about exploration and exploitation strategies and identify patterns and trends in player performance.
